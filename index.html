		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>Hi my name is Annika Verma i like to do coding and i like to bullet journaling because it takes up a lot of my spare time since my holidays have started!

			I am a student of the blue coat school and a becoming of a coding expert.
            
			I love to do different things and experiments like cooking a new recipe or doing caligraphy digitally and on paper. I love to do astronomy and research about different zodiac signs like how Libra-Meaning scale-Represents Scales and more things like the moon and the solar system. Bullet journaling is one of my favourite hobbies it can show what i do in a month year and days. It is easy and customizable.You dont need to go out and buy a big planning system or download a fancy app to your smartphone and you do not get the satisfaction of crossing of your to do list. It mainly frees up my brain space and helps me keep organised and makes me productive in daily life.
